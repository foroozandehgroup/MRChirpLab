# MRChirpLab

The Magnetic Resonance Chirp toolbox in MATLAB is organized as follows:
  
  - Tools available in directory functions
      - LinearChirp, directory for single linear chirp pulses
      - Magnetization, directory for linear chirp magnetization simulation
      - Sequences, directory for linear chirp pulse sequences
      
  - Examples of tools uses in directory examples
  
Remark: code and data from the article "Chirped ordered pulses for ultra-broadband ESR spectroscopy" available in tagged release 1.0
