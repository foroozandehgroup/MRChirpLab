# MRChirpLab

The Magnetic Resonance Chirp toolbox in MATLAB is organized as follows:
  
  - Tools available in directory functions
      - MRchirp, directory for pulses
      - Magnetization, directory for pulses magnetization simulation
      - Sequences, directory for MRchirp pulse sequences
      
  - Examples of tools uses in directory examples

Installation
  - Add the folder "functions" and its subfolders to your MATLAB path (Home -> Set Path -> Add with Subfolders).
